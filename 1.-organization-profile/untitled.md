# 1.1. Needs

The main focus of our organization is a _**fulfillment of children needs**_.

Needs can be material or financial.

A single child can have multiple needs.

There can be a single-time need like a _Clothing Item_ or reccuring needs like a _Medications Monthly_ or a _Physical Therapy Monthly_.

Sponsors are fulfilling those needs.

A single child can have a more then one sponsor.
