## Project Testing Requirements

### e2e testing

Contractor should perform and document results of End-to-End testing.

#### Functionality testing

* Outgoing links.
* Internal links.
* Anchor Links.
* MailTo LinksScripting checks on the form are working as expected. For example- if a user does not fill a mandatory field in a form an error message is shown.
* Check default values are being populated.
* Once submitted, the data in the forms is submitted to a live database or is linked to a working email address.
* Forms are optimally formatted for better readability.

#### Usability  testing

* Test the site Navigation.
* Menus, buttons or Links to different pages on your site should be easily visible and consistent on all webpages.
* Content should be legible with no spelling or grammatical errors.
* Images if present should contain an "alt" text.

#### Interface testing

* Application: Test requests are sent correctly to the Database and output at the client side is displayed correctly. Errors if any must be caught by the application and must be only shown to the administrator and not the end user.
* Web Server: Test Web server is handling all application requests without any service denial.
* Database Server: Make sure queries sent to the database give expected results.

#### Browser compatibility testing

* Test if your web application is being displayed correctly across browsers, JavaScript, AJAX and authentication is working fine. You may also check for Mobile Browser Compatibility.

#### Database testing

* Test if any errors are shown while executing queries.
* Data Integrity is maintained while creating, updating or deleting data in database.
* Check response time of queries and fine tune them if necessary.
* Test data retrieved from your database is shown accurately in your web application.

#### Performance testing

* Website application response times at different connection speeds.
* Load test your web application to determine its behavior under normal and peak loads.
* Stress test your web site to determine its break point when pushed to beyond normal loads at peak time.
* Test if a crash occurs due to peak load, how does the site recover from such an event.
* Make sure optimization techniques like gzip compression, browser and server side cache enabled to reduce load times.

#### Security testing

* Test unauthorized access to secure pages should not be permitted.
* Restricted files should not be downloadable without appropriate access.
* Check sessions are automatically killed after prolonged user inactivity.
* On use of SSL certificates, website should re-direct to encrypted SSL pages.

## Project Documentation Requirements

Project and project code should be well documented.

Recurring Sponsorship system that includes automated credit card management tools to handle expired cards, renewals and subscription changes. Implements a **Notification system** by tracking a status of donations and in that way utilize an interaction between **Sponsors** and their targets.

System should include instructions concerning payment methods and implement payment methods via Payment processors.
