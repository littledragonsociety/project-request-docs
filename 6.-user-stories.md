# 6. User Stories

TODO:finish it.

A user story is a lightweight method for quickly capturing the "who", "what" and "why" of a product requirement. In simple terms, user stories are stated ideas of requirements that express what users need. User stories are brief, with each element often containing fewer than 10 or 15 words each. User stories are "to-do" lists that help you determine the steps along the project's path. They help ensure that your process, as well as the resulting product, will meet your requirements.

A user story is defined incrementally, in three stages:

The brief description of the need The conversations that happen during backlog grooming and iteration planning to solidify the details The tests that confirm the story's satisfactory completion

**User Story Examples:**

* As a \[customer\], I want \[shopping cart feature\] so that \[I can easily purchase items online\].
* As an \[manager\], I want to \[generate a report\] so that \[I can understand which departments need more resources\].
* As a \[customer\], I want to \[receive an SMS when the item is arrived\] so that \[I can go pick it up right away\]

**In the examples above:**

Role represents the person, system, subsystem or any entity else who will interact with the system to be implemented to achieve a goal. He or she will gain values by interacting with the system. Action represents a user's expectation that can be accomplished through interacting with the system. Benefits represents the value behind the interaction with the system.
